{- Definition of 'Shape'
    Shapes are things that discriminate between outside and inside
-}
newtype Shape = Shape { inside :: Point -> Bool }

{- Basic Shapes
    These are the basic shapes used to construct more complicated shapes
-}

{-
    A simple empty shape
-}
empty :: Shape
empty = Shape $ const False

{-
    A disc with radius 1 located at (0,0)
-}
unitDisc :: Shape
unitDisc = Shape $ \(x, y) ->
    x^2 + y^2 <= 1

{-
    A square with length/width 1 located at (0,0)
-}
unitSq :: Shape
unitSq = Shape $ \(x, y) ->
    abs x <= 1 && abs y <= 1

{- Manipulations
   Functions to change and combine existing shapes into new shapes
-}

{- Translation
    Moving a shape along a vector
-}
translate :: Vector -> Shape -> Shape
translate (dx, dy) s = Shape $ \(x, y) ->
    inside s (x - dx, y - dy)

{- Inverting
    Inverting a shape i.e. switching outside vs inside
-}
negate :: Shape -> Shape
negate s = Shape $ not . inside s

{- General combinator
    Combining two shapes with a parametric boolean function
-}

    All points that are in both shapes

{- Matrix transformations
    Applying a matrix/linear transformation to a shape
-}
transformM :: Matrix -> Shape -> Shape

{-
    Stretch a shape along the X axis
-}

{-
    Stretch a shape
-}
stretch :: Float -> Shape -> Shape
stretch r = transformM $ Matrix (r, 0) (0, r)

{-
    Mirror a shape at the X-axis
-}
flipX :: Shape -> Shape

{-
    Mirror a shape at the Y-axis
-}

flip45 :: Shape -> Shape

{-
    Mirror a shape at the origin
-}
flip0 :: Shape -> Shape

{-
    Rotate a shape around the origin
-}
rotate :: Float -> Shape -> Shape

{- Semantics
    Here we render/interpret shapes in terms of "ASCII-Art" text files
-}

render :: Float -> Float -> Shape -> IO ()
